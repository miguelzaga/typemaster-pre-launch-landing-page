## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a bit more about the property overflow. I was having trouble with the layout in the desktop version. I was able to solve it using: 

```css
html,
body {
    overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

At the beginning I was only applying it to the body element. By chance I applied on both and it worked.

### Continued development

I need to improve my grid, flexblox and general layout skills.
